# Advent of Code 2024

Practising my acquired knowledge of `go`.

## Running

For each day, copy the `template/` directory and create a `dayXX/` directory.
Make sure to modify the package name, and in `main.go` replace the previous
day's import.

```fish
go run main.go a 01
```

## Testing

```fish
go test ./dayXX
```

## When will I get bored?

And some notes of what I learned

- [x] Day1
- [x] Day2 - `append` modifies the original slice
- [x] Day3
- [x] Day4 - make sure to copy slices as there are hacky ways in which my
slices can be modified due to reallocations
- [x] Day5
- [x] Day6 - oh so we cannot place obstacles in positions that the guard has
  already checked but is facing away from?
